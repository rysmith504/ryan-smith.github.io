/**control flow:

 * 1. Control flow is the order in which statements are executed in a program.

 * 2. The default control flow is for statements to be read and executed in order

 *      from left-to-right, top-to-bottom in the code.

 * 3. certain conditional statements, like if/else-if/else and switch statements, can alter the flow from its default path.

 */

// -'if' - specifies a block of code to be executed only if a conditional statement is true

// -'else if' - specifies a new condition to test, if previous condition is false

// -'else' - specifies a block of code to be executed, if all previous conditions are false

// -the code will be executed at the first true condition that is met then will exit the code block immediatly after

// -Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

if (field==empty) {

    promptUser();

} else {

    submitForm();

}

//For example, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks

//the Submit button for the form.

 

var x =1;

if(x === 1) {

    return true;  //returns true and code has compleated its task

}else{

    return false;

}

//in the above example, the flow stops at the first if condition and doesnt need to continue

//because the first condition has been met

 

// another example of if/else if/else is as follows

 

var timeOfDay = 21;

 

if (time < 10) {

    greeting = "Good morning";

  } else if (time < 20) {

    greeting = "Good day";

  } else {

    greeting = "Good evening";  // The result of greeting will be => Good evening

  }

  //timeOfDay var is 21 so the code will run through the first if statement and not hit any code because 21 is greater than 10

  //then it goes through the else if statement and also doesnt hit any code because 21 is still greater than 20

  //finally it reaches the else statement and runs the code because that is the only option left in the conditional and because

  //it is a true value

 

//

//   The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

 

switch(expression) {

    case x:

      // code block

      break;

    case y:

      // code block

      break;

    default:

      // code block

  }

 

  //This is how it works:

 

// The switch expression evaluated once.

// The value of the expression compared with the values of each case.

// If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

// If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

 

//The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.

 

//(Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 ..)

 

//This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

 

switch (new Date().getDay()) {

  case 0:

    day = "Sunday";

    break;

  case 1:

    day = "Monday";

    break;

  case 2:

    break;

  case 3:

    day = "Wednesday";

    break;

  case 4:

    day = "Thursday";

    break;

  case 5:

    day = "Friday";

    break;

  case 6:

    day = "Saturday";
